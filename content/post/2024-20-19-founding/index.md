Medical centers from Europe, the U.S., and Australia join the Liver AI Consortium 

<!--more-->

The Liver Artificial Intelligence (LAI) consortium is dedicated to accelerating the development, validation, and implementation of machine learning methods to enhance MRI-based diagnosis of liver lesions. A key objective of the consortium is to create a publicly available benchmark MRI dataset comprising over 3,000 patients with pathologically confirmed lesion phenotypes. This dataset will facilitate the development and evaluation of AI tools designed to automate the diagnosis of solid-appearing liver lesions on MRI. 

 

To ensure the dataset is representative of a diverse global population, we are collaborating with medical centers across three continents. This approach guarantees a wide range of patient characteristics, liver lesion types, liver diseases, and MRI equipment. By accounting for these variations, we aim to develop AI methods that are robust enough to ensure patients from all around the world can benefit from the technology. 

 

The following hospitals have joined us in this mission to enhance liver lesion diagnosis by contributing data: 

- Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands 
- Academisch Ziekenhuis Maastricht, The Netherlands 
- University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands 
- University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands 
- Stichting Amsterdam UMC, The Netherlands 
- Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris, France 
- Università Di Pisa, Italy 
- Università Degli Studi Di Palermo, Italy 
- Institute Jules Bordet, Belgium 
- Medical University of Gdansk, Poland 
- Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, United States of America
- Austin Health, Australia

 

With these partners, we are able to gather a wide range of patient and radiological data, but we are always open to new members who want to contribute to our mission. If you are interested in joining our effort to improve liver lesion diagnosis, please contact us at lai.info@erasmusmc.nl.
