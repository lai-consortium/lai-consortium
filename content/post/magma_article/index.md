The Liver Artificial Intelligence (LAI) consortium is dedicated to accelerating the development, validation, and implementation of machine learning methods to enhance MRI-based diagnosis of liver lesions. A key objective of the consortium is to create a publicly available benchmark MRI dataset comprising over 3,000 patients with pathologically confirmed lesion phenotypes. This dataset will facilitate the development and evaluation of AI tools designed to automate the diagnosis of solid-appearing liver lesions on MRI.
