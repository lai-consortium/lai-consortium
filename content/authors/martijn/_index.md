# Biography
Martijn Starmans is assistant professor leading the AI for Integrated Diagnostics (AIID) research line, with a dual appointment at the Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam (BIGR) (Dept. of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine) and PHANTOM group (Department of Pathology) of the Erasmus MC (Rotterdam, the Netherlands). His main research interest is the use of AI to improve the diagnostic work-up through integrated diagnostics, focussed on radiology (“radiomics”) and pathology (“pathomics”). Specifically, he develops multi-modal machine learning methods to simultanously co-learn from both modalities (“radiopathomics”), and automated machine learning and meta-learning methods to generalize these methods across clinial applications. For this idea, he received an [NWO AiNed Personal Fellowship Grant](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/ained-fellowship-grant-for-dr-ir-martijn-p-a-starmans). He works on a variety of clinical applications, mainly oncology (e.g. sarcoma, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma, cardiology, neuroendocrine tumors).

**Collaborations**

Martijn is involved in various working groups and is leader of the platform work package of the Horizon 2020 [EuCanImage consortium](https://eucanimage.eu/): *Towards a European cancer imaging platform for enhanced Artificial Intelligence in oncology*. In this context, he visited the [AI in Medicine group](https://www.bcn-aim.org/) of Prof. Dr. Karim Lekadir at the University of Barcelona for four months. He is also leader of harmonization and integration work package the Horizon Infro [EOSC4Cancer](https://EOSC4Cancer.eu/) consortium, in wich he is harmonizing and integrating data, data models, and data repositories from various modalities.

He is one of the initiators of the Sarcoma Artificial Intelligence (SAI) consortium ([grant awarded](https://www.hanarthfonds.nl/en/stefan-klein)), the Liver AI (LAI) consortium ([grant awarded](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/seven-application-oriented-projects-can-start-through-open-technology-programme)), and project lead of the Colorectal Liver Metastes AI (COLIMA) consortium (grant submitted). In these consortia, in total 51 clinical centers, companies, professional- and patient associations from 18 countries are united. Additionally, he is external advisor of [RadioVal](https://radioval.eu/), and member of [EUCAIM](https://EUCAIM.eu/). He has been a visiting researcher of the [BCN-AIM lab](https://www.bcn-aim.org/) of the University of Barcelona.

He is one of the Open Data Chairs of [MICCAI 2024](https://conferences.miccai.org/2024/en/).

**PhD Degree**

Martijn obtained his PhD degree *''cum laude''* on February 1 2022 at the Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam with his thesis titled *[Streamlined Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Development: Generalization of radiomics through automated machine learning](https://repub.eur.nl/pub/137089/thesis-MPA-Starmans-embargo-version-61c5831509bd6.pdf)*. Following his passion to efficiently and automatically optimize routines, he developed an adaptive radiomics framework using automated machine learning, described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08618.pdf). He collaborated with a large number of clinicians to develop radiomics biomarkers in a wide variety of clinical applications.
